This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.5.

It's currently upgraded and using version 8.0.2.

## Setup

Make sure you have `nodejs@16.x` installed. This is easiest using nvm, which is a nodejs version manager:

```sh
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.38.0/install.sh | bash
nvm i 16
nvm use 16
npm i
```
## Development server

Run `npx ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `npx ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `npx ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `npx ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `npx ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `npx ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
